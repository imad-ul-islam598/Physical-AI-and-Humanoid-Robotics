# Content Standards and Style Guide

## Writing Style

All content must follow a clear, structured, and technically accurate writing style with beginner-friendly explanations before deeper technical content. Maintain an academic tone with no marketing language, using short sentences and clean formatting throughout.

### Tone and Language
- Use formal, academic language appropriate for educational content
- Avoid marketing or promotional language
- Write with short, clear sentences
- Use clean, well-organized formatting
- Provide beginner-friendly explanations before introducing deeper technical concepts

### Technical Accuracy
- All information must be technically accurate and verifiable
- Do not include hallucinated or non-existent technology
- All code examples must be runnable and properly tested
- Maintain consistency in terminology throughout the textbook

## Audience Focus

Content is designed for students aged 16+, early engineering learners, and robotics beginners who possess basic Python knowledge. All materials must be accessible to this target audience.

### Accessibility Guidelines
- Explain concepts in a way that assumes only basic Python knowledge
- Provide step-by-step explanations for complex topics
- Use analogies and real-world examples where appropriate
- Ensure content is suitable for self-study and classroom use

## Formatting Standards

All content follows Docusaurus MDX format with headings up to level 4. Include Python, ROS 2, and C++ code blocks when needed, along with diagrams described in text, tables, bullets, and summaries.

### Document Structure
- Use H1 for chapter titles (#)
- Use H2 for major sections (##)
- Use H3 for subsections (###)
- Use H4 for minor sections (####)
- Never use headings below H4

### Code Formatting
- Use proper syntax highlighting for all code blocks
- Language identifiers: `python`, `cpp`, `javascript`, `bash`, `json`, etc.
- Include comments in code examples to explain complex concepts
- Ensure all code examples are properly indented and formatted

### Lists and Content Organization
- Use bullet points for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bold formatting (**text**) for key terms when first introduced
- Use italics (*text*) for emphasis where appropriate

## Chapter Template Compliance

Every chapter must contain:
- Introduction
- Learning Objectives
- Key Concepts
- Technical Explanation
- Diagrams written as text descriptions
- Code Examples
- Exercises
- Summary

### Section Requirements

#### Introduction
- Provide context for the chapter
- Explain why the topic is important
- Preview what will be covered

#### Learning Objectives
- List 3-7 specific, measurable objectives
- Use action verbs (define, explain, analyze, apply)
- Focus on what students should be able to do after reading

#### Key Concepts
- List 3-8 important concepts introduced in the chapter
- Provide brief definitions for each concept
- Use bold formatting for concept names

#### Technical Explanation
- Provide detailed explanation of concepts
- Include mathematical formulations where appropriate
- Explain relationships between concepts
- Use diagrams to illustrate complex ideas

#### Diagrams written as text descriptions
- Include 2-4 diagrams per chapter
- Provide detailed text descriptions of each diagram
- Use ASCII art or text-based representations where helpful
- Explain the purpose of each diagram

#### Code Examples
- Include 1-3 practical code examples per chapter
- Use Python, C++, or other appropriate languages as needed
- Include comments explaining complex concepts
- Ensure all examples are technically accurate

#### Exercises
- Include 4-6 exercises of varying difficulty
- Cover conceptual, practical, and implementation challenges
- Provide hints for complex problems
- Align exercises with learning objectives

#### Summary
- Concisely summarize key points
- Reinforce main concepts
- Connect to broader themes in Physical AI

## Quality Standards

No hallucinated technology is allowed. All examples must be technically accurate and runnable. Maintain consistent depth across chapters to ensure educational coherence.

### Content Review Checklist
