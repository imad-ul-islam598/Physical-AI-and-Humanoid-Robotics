# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Writing Style
Clear, structured, and technically accurate content that prioritizes beginner-friendly explanations before deeper technical content. Maintain an academic tone with no marketing language, using short sentences and clean formatting throughout.

### II. Audience Focus
Content is designed for students aged 16+, early engineering learners, and robotics beginners who possess basic Python knowledge. All materials must be accessible to this target audience.

### III. Formatting Standards
All content follows Docusaurus MDX format with headings up to level 4. Include Python, ROS 2, and C++ code blocks when needed, along with diagrams described in text, tables, bullets, and summaries. Every chapter must follow the prescribed template.

### IV. Docusaurus Framework
The project must be initialized using `npx create-docusaurus@latest frontend classic` command. Do not generate folder structures manually.

### V. Chapter Template Compliance
Every chapter must contain: Introduction, Learning Objectives, Key Concepts, Technical Explanation, Diagrams written as text descriptions, Code Examples, Exercises, and Summary.

### VI. Quality Standards
No hallucinated technology is allowed. All examples must be technically accurate and runnable. Maintain consistent depth across chapters to ensure educational coherence.

## Book Structure

The textbook is organized into 7 parts with 19 chapters covering:
1. Foundations of Physical AI (3 chapters)
2. ROS 2, the Robotic Nervous System (3 chapters)
3. Digital Twins with Gazebo and Unity (3 chapters)
4. NVIDIA Isaac Platform (3 chapters)
5. Vision Language Action (VLA) (3 chapters)
6. Humanoid Robot Engineering (3 chapters)
7. Capstone Project (1 chapter)

## Content Standards
All content must be technically accurate and runnable. No fabricated or non-existent technology should be presented as real. Maintain consistent depth across all chapters.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. All content must comply with these standards. Amendments require proper documentation and approval.
